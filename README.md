## 1. The Vibe/Theme

**Theme:** Cyberpunk Esports

**Reason:** A dark, futuristic cyberpunk theme matches the competitive gaming vibe of an esports team. The neon accents create an immersive, high-tech atmosphere that appeals to gamers and represents the cutting-edge nature of esports competition.

## 2. Color Palette

**Primary Color (Hex):** #39ff14

**Accent Color (Hex):** #bf00ff

**Reason:** Neon green (#39ff14) represents energy, technology, and gaming culture - it's the classic "hacker" color that gamers instantly recognize. Purple (#bf00ff) adds mystery, luxury, and a premium contrast. Together, they create the iconic cyberpunk aesthetic that dominates modern gaming visuals.

## 3. Typography (Fonts)

**Font Family:** Courier New (Monospace)

**Reason:** Monospace fonts have a "hacker/terminal" feel that fits the cyberpunk gaming theme perfectly. The fixed-width characters create a technical, futuristic look reminiscent of computer terminals and code - exactly what gamers and tech enthusiasts connect with.
