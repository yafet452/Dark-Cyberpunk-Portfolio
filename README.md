## 1. The Vibe/Theme

**Theme:** Dark Cyberpunk Elegance

**Reason:** I chose a dark theme with neon cyan accents to create a modern, futuristic aesthetic that feels premium and professional. The dark background reduces eye strain and makes the colorful elements pop, creating an immersive experience that stands out from typical portfolios.

## 2. Color Palette

| Color Role | Hex Code | Preview |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **Primary Color** | `#00d4ff` | Neon Cyan |
| **Accent Color** | `#ff6b9d` | Soft Pink |
| **Background** | `#0a0e17` | Deep Midnight |
| **Card Background** | `#121a2b` | Navy Blue |

**Reason:** The neon cyan (#00d4ff) creates energy and a tech-forward feel, while the soft pink accent (#ff6b9d) adds warmth and visual interest. The deep dark background (#0a0e17) provides excellent contrast and a premium, sophisticated appearance.

## 3. Typography (Fonts)

**Font Family:** Outfit (Google Fonts)

**Reason:** Outfit is a modern geometric sans-serif font that is clean, highly readable, and has a contemporary feel. Its varied weights (300-700) allow for excellent visual hierarchy between headings and body text.

## 4. AI Contribution

**Best Prompt I Used:**

> "Build a modern portfolio website with a dark cyberpunk theme. Use neon cyan (#00d4ff) as the primary accent color. Include sections for: hero with animated gradient orbs, about me with stats, skills with progress bars, project cards, and a contact form. Use the Outfit font from Google Fonts. Add smooth scroll, hover animations, and glassmorphism effects. Make it fully responsive."
